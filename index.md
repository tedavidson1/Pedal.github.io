# Project Pedal

## Motivation
The currently used software is lacking in both functional and technical features:
- Hard to update price for service and parts of bikes
- One-sided system with no mobile interaction
- Customer and shop unable to effectively communicate
- Outdated codebase in Visual Basic
- Lack of exception handling
- Lack of documentation

## User Categories
The two user categories are customers of the campus bike shop and the employees of the bike shop.
These two groups of users drive what core features the software will provide.

## Core Features

### Customer Side
- Simple and clear UI
- Mobile-friendly website interface
- Provide status checking for service
- Simple and easy communication with am employee

### Bike Shop Employee Side
- Ticket handling interface
- Service handling interface
- Updatable prices and services interface
- Convenient communication with customer

## Technical Details
While certain elements are still up in the air, the current plan is as follows:
- usage of a UA domain
- SQL database already is available for our use
- Previous data will not be transferred. This is a brand new system.
- Web-based front-end built using Svelte
- Microsoft SQL for the database
- Python back-end using Flask to serve the webpage and access the database
